# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge
We expect respectful and professional behavior in issues, PRs, and discussions.

## Expected behavior
- Be respectful and constructive.
- Focus on technical discussion and outcomes.
- Critique code/ideas, not people.
- Assume good intent, ask for clarification before escalating.
- If you make a mistake, acknowledge it and move on.
